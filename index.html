<h2>The Poorly Named Bubble Note Game</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The Poorly Named Bubble Note Game is an endless game where you can pop bubbles to form chains of notes to make music.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Have fun!!
Make some music!!
Pop some damn bubbles!!
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual creative super-limited sandbox game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players use a mouse to play the game. A mouseclick will make the game window become fullscreen and unpause the game. Another mouseclick will pause the game and exit fullscreen mode. The avatar symbol will follow the player's mouse pointer around the game world where it can bump into other objects like buttons and bubbles. Bumping into a bubble will pop it and produce and corresponding sound. This sound will either be a musical note or a popping noise signifying a bubble with no musical notes inside of it. Each bubble popped is added to a play queue which can form a musical score. Bubbles with no notes inside of them increase the duration of silence between individual notes in the musical chain.
<p>By guiding the avatar into the buttons in the game world the player can activate game functions. The four buttons with the musical notes will spawn bubbles into the game world when they are bumped by the avatar. The button with the large "X" will clear the existing musical chain of notes allowing players to start a new composition. The button with the play symbol will play all notes currently in the musical chain queue when bumped by the avatar.</p>
<p>NOTE: Due to the nature of a Phaser function the game can currently only play the musical note chain once per game session.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The freeform and partially pseudorandom destruction of things leads to the creation of other things mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This is a game with a lot of bubbles that was not inspired or related to Bubble Bobble. If this game had a rating it would be rated E for Everyone. No microtransactions or DLC are planned at this time. Play the game simply or skillfully as you seek to make musical chains of notes or just want to pop some bubbles.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game world is anything and everything (abstraction most definitely present). The bubbles are memories or sounds or emotions, or whatever you want them to mean to you. You, the All-being. Guide the notes to make something greater or just consider them isolated noises representing everything, nothing.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are the All-being. An entity of limitless power who has somehow forgotten your own identity. Piece together the musical notes in the perfect combination and unlock all your forgotten memories. Remember your creation of worlds, your doting on species over eons, and how you played marbles with the stars. The melodic sounds can spur the sudden remembrance of anything you desire. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who play Bejeweled 2 nonstop. Bubble popping fanatics. Anyone with low-level musical ability.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Play as long as you want. A chain of notes can be made in under a minute. Play until you get bored of popping bubbles.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players can avoid different colored bubbles in order to create a desired note chain. They can also continue spawning bubbles while popping the undesired bubbles until a certain number of desired note bubbles remain. Players can then use the reset button to create their perfect musical score.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Music sounds acquired under the SoundSnap license. Popping, bell, silent, and reset button sounds aquired under public domain from SoundBible and Xamuel.com. Avatar symbol and bubble image acquired from Wikipedia Commons public domain. Background Watercolor Man Standing In Rain acquired from PublicDomainPictures.net.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
One way collision in the Arcade Physics Phaser examples was most influential on this prototype. Other games of influence include Mario Paint and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
